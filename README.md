My name is Nishit and I am a graduate student at Drexel University. In addition to my expertise with a variety of coding languages, I'm attempting to learn new ones gradually. My portfolio presents me better than words ever could, so if you'd like, we can look at it together and I can tell you about the projects I designed and built over the years. I strive to perform well in all roles of full stack development, and I enjoy every aspect of the process.
